## ⏱️ Working with Sessions

### Starting a Task Session

**From Dashboard:**
1. Find a recommended task
2. Click **30 min** or **60 min** button
3. Timer modal opens

**From Task Library or Domain Panel:**
1. Click on any task card
2. Choose duration

### Timer Controls

**Before Starting:**
- **Chunks (N)** - Split work into multiple focus segments (1-12)
- **Break (min)** - Break duration between chunks (0-30 min)
- **Bell** - Toggle sound notifications on/off
- **Volume** - Adjust notification volume

**Examples:**
- `3 chunks × 20 min + 2 × 5 min breaks` = 70 min total (60 work + 10 break)
- `1 chunk × 60 min + 0 breaks` = 60 min continuous work

**During Session:**
- **Pause** - Pause the timer temporarily
- **+5m** - Add 5 minutes to current focus segment (focus only)
- **Skip Break** - Skip the current break and continue working
- **Not This** - Skip this task and choose a replacement
- **Stop** (⏹️) - End session early

**Minimize Timer:**
- Click minimize button or press **M** key
- Timer becomes a floating mini-player
- Drag to reposition
- Click to expand back to full view

### Skip Replacement Flow

When you click **"Not This"**:
1. Task's "dread" counter increases
2. Task is snoozed for 90 minutes
3. You see 3 alternative tasks matched to your energy
4. Select a replacement or close to take a break

This helps you avoid repeatedly skipping the same tasks.

### Session Completion

When a session completes:
- ✅ Time is recorded in your history
- 🔔 Completion sound plays (if enabled)
- **One-time tasks** → Marked as done
- **Recurring tasks** → Stay in todo list for next occurrence
- **Projects** → Remaining minutes reduced

- **Custom** - Define your own hourly energy pattern

**How It Works:**
1. Set your profile in **Settings → Bio-Rhythm**
2. When you click **"Start My Day"**, the app:
   - Sets your current energy based on time of day
